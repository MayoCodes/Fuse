# Fuse

Just a fun project I made. Simple party game inspired by Heads Up and Outburst. Players team up into pairs and organize themselves around a circle where each person is diagnal to their pair. They must take turns passing the phone around the circle and holding it up to their head. If you get the phone, your partner has to help you guess the word on your forehead without saying what it is before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out while you have the phone you and your partner are eliminated. Rounds go on until one pair is left. Have Fun!
